# 💬 AI Chat Frontend Application

This is a **frontend-only React-based application** that simulates a modern, responsive AI chatting interface. It provides an engaging UI for users to interact with an AI assistant in a chat-like environment. The UI is built with performance and accessibility in mind, using React and Tailwind CSS.

> ⚠️ This project is frontend-only and **does not include backend AI logic** or real-time messaging. It is ideal for demos, UI testing, and integration with AI APIs like OpenAI, Cohere, or custom backends.
